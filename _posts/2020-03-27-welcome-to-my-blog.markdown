Today, I'm starting my simple personal blog! :tada::tada::tada:

This blog is a [Jeykll](https://jekyllrb.com/) based and hosted on [Github](https://github.com) :heart:

As a start I used a [Kean's blog](https://github.com/kean/kean.github.io). I do like how it's simple and clear and I think this can be a good start, but I'm going to support later more features related to blog (pagination, Newsletter, etc.)

Here is a place to share and discuss with you my interests and technical experience (for all levels). Hopefully, this could make your life better and easier. Thank you :heart:
